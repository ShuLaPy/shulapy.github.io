I’m Shubham 👋 — a backend engineer who spends most of his time making servers go fast and APIs behave.

![The Great Shubham Lad](https://res.cloudinary.com/zeuadaprogramming/image/upload/v1768934051/Blog/Gemini_Generated_Image_lpiaozlpiaozlpia_xay6xl.png)

I build scalable systems with **Node.js** (yes, I actually enjoy the event loop), and I use **Python** when I need to move fast, automate things, or build something smart. These days I’m also deep into **GenAI + AI agents** — RAG, workflows, multi-agent setups — basically teaching software to do the boring parts while I focus on the fun problems.

I like clean architecture (so future-me doesn’t hate present-me), real-world performance tuning, and shipping things that don’t fall apart at 2 AM 🕑. 

If you’re here to explore my work, steal a few ideas, or just vibe with engineering chaos — welcome 😄
