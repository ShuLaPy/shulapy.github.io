        I learned everything from community so working with a team is the best
        qulity in me. The best thing about learning from community is you get
        lots of good knowledge and also you feel like you need to give back to
        community and that's why I started a youtube channel
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0dmBOtjUAPtYLzLvtegXoQ"
          >AwfulCodeLab</a
        >
        to contribute to community also I started a blog
        <a href="https://awfulcodelab.co">awfulcodelab.co</a> where I write posts
        mostly related to Data Structures & Web Development.
